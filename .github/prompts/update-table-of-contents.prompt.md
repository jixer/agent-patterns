Within the `/README.md` file of this repository, there is a section for "Patterns Table of Contents". Your goal is to update that section to include a list of all patterns that exist within the `/patterns/` folder of this repository.

For each pattern, include a one line description that summarizes the pattern. Use the `README.md` file within each pattern folder as the source of truth for the description. 

Represent the patterns in a markdown list format as follows:
- [**<Pattern Name>**](<Pattern Link Relative to root>): <One line description of the pattern>

Ensure that the patterns are listed in alphabetical order by pattern name and that there are not duplicates.
