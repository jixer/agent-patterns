# Pattern: [Pattern Name]

## Also known as
*Optional: Alternative names or aliases for this pattern*

## Context

*Describe the situation or environment where this pattern is applicable. What are the conditions that make this pattern relevant? What kind of AI system or use case does this address?*

*Example: You are building an AI agent that needs to perform complex reasoning tasks, interact with external tools, or solve multi-step problems. The agent must be able to break down complex queries and systematically work through solutions while maintaining transparency in its decision-making process.*

## Problem

**How does [specific challenge] get addressed in AI agent systems?**

*State the core problem this pattern solves in a clear, concise question or statement. Focus on the specific challenge that AI agents face.*

## Forces
